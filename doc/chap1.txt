  [33X[0;0Y[5XLOOPS[105X is a package for [5XGAP4[105X whose purpose is to:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yprovide   researchers   in  nonassociative  algebra  with  a  powerful
        computational tool concerning finite loops and quasigroups,[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yextend [5XGAP[105X toward the realm of nonassociative structures.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XLOOPS[105X has been accepted as an official package of [5XGAP[105X in May 2015.[133X

  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YInstallation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YHave [5XGAP 4.7[105X or newer installed on your computer.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you do not see the subfolder [11Xpkg/loops[111X in the main directory of [5XGAP[105X then
  download    the    [5XLOOPS[105X    package    from    the    distribution   website
  [7Xhttp://www.math.du.edu/loops[107X  and  unpack  the  downloaded file into the [11Xpkg[111X
  subfolder.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe   package   [5XLOOPS[105X   can  then  be  loaded  to  [5XGAP[105X  anytime  by  calling
  [10XLoadPackage("loops");[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you  wish  to  load  [5XLOOPS[105X  automatically while starting [5XGAP[105X, start [5XGAP[105X,
  execute the following commands,[133X
  
  gap> pref := UserPreference( "PackagesToLoad " );;
  gap> Add( pref, "loops" );;
  gap> SetUserPreference( "PackagesToLoad", pref );;
  gap> WriteGapIniFile();;
  
  [33X[0;0Yquit [5XGAP[105X and restart it.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3 [33X[0;0YDocumentation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe documentation has been prepared with the [5XGAPDoc[105X package and is therefore
  available in several formats: LaTeX, pdf, ps, html, and as an inline help in
  [5XGAP[105X.  All  these  formats  have  been  obtained directly from the master XML
  documentation file. Consequently, the different formats of the documentation
  differ only in their appearance, not in content.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe preferred format of the documentation is html with MathJax turned on.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAll  formats  of  the documentation can be found in the [11Xdoc[111X folder of [5XLOOPS[105X.
  You can also download the documentation from the [5XLOOPS[105X distribution website.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  inline  [5XGAP[105X help is available upon installing [5XLOOPS[105X and can be accessed
  in  the  usual  way, i.e., upon typing [10X?command[110X, [5XGAP[105X displays the section of
  the [5XLOOPS[105X manual containing information about [10Xcommand[110X.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.4 [33X[0;0YTest Files[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YTest  files  conforming  to  [5XGAP[105X standards are provided for [5XLOOPS[105X and can be
  found  in  the  folder [11Xtst[111X. The command [10XReadPackage("loops","tst/testall.g")[110X
  runs all tests for [5XLOOPS[105X.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.5 [33X[0;0YMemory Management[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YSome  libraries of loops are loaded only upon explicit demand and can occupy
  a  lot  of  memory. For instance, the library or RCC loops occupies close to
  100  MB  of  memory  when fully loaded. The command [10XLOOPS_FreeMemory();[110X will
  attempt to free memory by unbinding on-demand library data loaded by [5XLOOPS[105X.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.6 [33X[0;0YFeedback[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe   welcome  all  comments  and  suggestions  on  [5XLOOPS[105X,  especially  those
  concerning  the  future  development  of  the package. You can contact us by
  e-mail.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.7 [33X[0;0YAcknowledgment[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  thank  the following people for sending us remarks and comments, and for
  suggesting  new  functionality of the package: Muniru Asiru, Bjoern Assmann,
  Andreas  Distler, Aleš Drápal, Steve Flammia, Kenneth W. Johnson, Michael K.
  Kinyon, Alexander Konovalov, Frank Lübeck and Jonathan D.H. Smith.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  library  of Moufang loops of order 243 was generated from data provided
  by Michael C. Slattery and Ashley L. Zenisek. The library of right conjugacy
  closed  loops  of  order  less  than  28 was generated from data provided by
  Katharina  Artic.  The library of commutative automorphic loops of order 27,
  81 and 243 was obtained jointly with Izabella Stuhl.[133X
